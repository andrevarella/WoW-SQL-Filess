Installation
------------

Extract this archive into your Interface\AddOns folder. The full path
to the files should end up being something like:
C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\Poisoner\Poisoner.toc
and so on.


Usage
-----

When the addon is installed, a small button is displayed near the minimap.
Click and drag the button to move it to a desired location. To apply poisons
to your weapons, mouse over the minimap button and a menu of the poisons in
your packs will pop up. Click the poison type with the left mouse button to
apply it to your main hand weapon, and with the right mouse button to apply
it to your offhand weapon.

The following commands are provided:

	/poisoner enable
		Enable display of the poisoner button.

	/poisoner disable
		Disable display of the poisoner button.

	/poisoner lock
		Prevent the poisoner button from being dragged.

	/poisoner unlock
		Allow the poisoner button to be dragged.

	/poisoner scale <multiplier>
		Set the scale of the poisoner menu to <multiplier>.

	/poisoner position {left|right}
		Set which side of the minimap button the menu appears.

	/poisoner reset
		Reset the position and scale of the poisoner button.


Poisoner is enabled by default for Rogues, and disabled by default for all
other classes.


Notes and known issues
----------------------

If there are already poisons on the selected weapon you will get a popup
confirmation dialog. If you choose 'No' from this dialog your cursor may
still have the poison selected; hit escape or right click in open space to
clear this condition.

Localisation is EXPERIMENTAL. If your WoW client uses a language other than
English, please let me know whether or not it works for you.
