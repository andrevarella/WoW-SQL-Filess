Description

	PhanxBuffs is a basic replacement for the default UI's buff, debuff,
	and temporary enchant (weapon buff) frames.

	It looks and acts basically like the default buff frames, with a few
	improvements:

	* Buff and debuff icons are sorted by their remaining duration
	* Text timers are shown only when less than 30 seconds remain
	* Weapon buff icons can show the spell or item that buffed your
	  weapon, instead of the weapon itself
	* Buff tooltips show who cast the buff on you
	* Buffs or debuffs you never want to see can be hidden
	* Basic configuration options are available

	Things that will probably be added in the future:

	* ButtonFacade support
	* Wrap icons to more than one row, with configurable row lengths
	* GUI for modifying buff and debuff ignore lists

Usage

	Options are available by typing "/pbuff" or navigating to the
	PhanxBuffs panel in the standard Interface Options window.

	There is currently no GUI for adding or removing buffs or debuffs
	from the ignore lists. The easiest way to edit the lists is to open
	the relevant file (Buffs.lua or Debuffs.lua) and edit the ignore
	list at the top.
